# JS-HTML-CSS-Socket.io-Node.js-Poker-Chips-Application
JS/HTML/CSS, Socket.io, Node.js Version of Poker Chips Application. At a halt because I am switching to native code (so there are some thing little things that are not finished)

If you see inconsitancies, in regards to code that achieves the same thing but is written in a different way, it is because I was constantly testing different paths to achieve the ideas I had in mind.
